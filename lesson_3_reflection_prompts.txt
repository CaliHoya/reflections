When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When you need to collaborate with others, when you want to have a project open source, or when you want another copy of your project remotely.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because you may not always want to integrate the changes made on the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches point to different commits that are on separate tracks. Clones are copies of a repository either from remote to local or local to local. Fork is a clone from remote to remote.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can then keep in mind how many commits have been made since you pushed to the remote repository. This is especially good to make sure to continue to update the remote repository when your changes are ready.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
