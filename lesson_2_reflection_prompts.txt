How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area consists of the files you want to commit to the repository that consist of a logical change.
The working directory are all files in the directory, and the repository are all committed changes.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
